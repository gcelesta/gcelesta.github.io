		<h4 class="transcriptiontitle">Mystery Songs</h4>
		<p class="transcriptionparagraph">Once at least, during the winter, the people gathered in the largest underground house, and each in turn sung his mystery-songs either the most powerful song obtained from his guardians, or the one best adapted for the purpose of the ceremony. Each man, in his song, told whatever was wonderful or important that had happened to his spirit since last they sang the mystery-songs. A very few of the men danced when they sang. This ceremony trained all the youths in the singing of their mystery-songs, to give them self-confidence, to find out how they were progressing, what their guardians were, and who among them was likely to become great.</p>

		<h4>Log Entry</h4>
		<p>I used <a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="_blank">GIMP</a> to enhance the scanned image with the <b>Unsharp Mask</b>.  This filter sharpened the image and generated a greater contrast between the text and background.  I then cropped the image to remove border artifacts; provide consistent margin widths; and reduce the image size.  Finally, I resized the image to 600x859 pixels at 100 dots per inch<sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup> to fit properly on the web page.</p>
		<p>I faced two challenges editing the image.  First, the various filters I experimented with did not remove all of the artifacts, such as the text or images on the other side of the page which bled through during the scanning process.  Second, the text was less legible after reducing the size of the image.</p>
		<p>The process I took to transcribe the document was to: embed a copy of the image within <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/word/" target="_blank">Word</a>; crop the image to isolate the text for transcription; and type the text.  Then I proofread the transcription and corrected one error.  The only transcription decision I made was to ensure the width of the text on the web page was approximately 66 characters wide for optimal reading.</p>
		<p>Some advantages of editable text format presentable on the web are the text is searchable or indexed quicker; can be interactive via hyperlinks or user comments; can be copied.  Some advantages of the digital facsimile are affording access to a book so users can view the artwork, layout, font, and paper.  This allows the view to draw their own conclusions based on the entire piece and ensure its correctness.</p>
