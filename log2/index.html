<p>Zotero software utilizes modularity when combining various elements, during the "scraping" process, to assemble a citation. For example, Zotero automatically retrieves and stores a PDF copy of the corresponding journal article. Zotero also exposes an application programming interface (API) for external access to the stored citations in whole or part. A prime example of this is granting access to BibBase to generate a bibliography, which can be embedded - as a module - within a web page.</p>

<p>The "scraping" process is a form of automation too. This process bypasses the human and relies on browser or other database APIs to accurately collect the appropriate citation information rather than the user copying and pasting the data. When Zotero is active within Firefox, the user simply presses the icon in the URI field and the article information is added automatically. Another example of automation is reformatting citations to different predefined or user-defined templates on the fly.</p>

<p>Reformatting citations to a specific style is also a demonstration of variability. There are also significant differences between the browser plug-in, web, and standalone interfaces in how they render the content and in what form and resolution. For example, the browser plug-in is constrained to the lower portion of the screen limiting the amount of information that can be displayed. The standalone and web interfaces offer more visible options to modify stored citations.</p>
