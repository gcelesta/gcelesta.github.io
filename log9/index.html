<a href="{{ site.url }}/static/game.html">Game: "Dead in Space"</a>

<p>The player is the sole survivor of an alien attack on their starship and must search the ship for fuel rods in order to return them safely to Earth.  This game was designed for the sake of creating an interesting game rather than addressing any particular cultural or social issue.</p>

<p>The only "objects" are stolen fission reactor fuel rods.  In order to win the game, the player must find all three.  There are no other uses for these objects and they do not change over time.</p>

<p>An "interface study" of this text adventure game would reveal that some information is withheld from the player.  For example, movement choices are provided as hyperlinks, displaying cardinal directions or other simple descriptive text.  Once certain rooms are visited, their links are replaced by the name of the room.  This is to prevent the user from building a mental map beforehand.  In addition, each room displays the number of fuel rods collected.</p>

<p>Given the player is situated as the sole survivor, there is virtually no interaction.  The only exception might be the static information, such as the Captain's log and computer status report, that helps establish the narrative.  These designs choices suggest that the player must explore the starship and solve the puzzle on their own.</p>

<p>The game displays images of a fuel rod or alien if either is found in a room.  The game play log might include a limited save functionality too.  Once a fuel rod is discovered a count is incremented and, if the player returns to the room, the fuel rod can't be found again.  The game remains faithful to the genre of science fiction text adventure game.</p>

<p>My game benefitted from the in-class alpha testing by identifying two issues.  First, the objective, after finding the three fuel rods, wasn't clear so I added instructions for the player to find the engine room.  Second, the game concluded with "GAME OVER".  My classmate wasn't sure if she won or lost.  I changed the conclusion to "THE END" since it's a narrative style game.</p>
