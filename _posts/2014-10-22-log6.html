<p>I used <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/" target="_blank">Voyant Tools</a> to analyze the English translation of short story <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23058" target="_blank">"The Queen of Spades"</a> by the Russian author, Alexander Pushkin.</p>

<p>Voyant is able to parse the text and display the most frequent words, as either a list, with relative frequencies, or a cirrus.  Other features include keywords in context and word trends.  These are details not readily evident to the reader.</p>

<p>The tool is unable to show a reader the plot, theme, and style of a story.  I think the tool would have difficulty demonstrating character development or identifying the setting too.</p>

<p>The Cirrus graphic allowed me to quickly identify the main characters.  I then filtered the corpus by some of the character names and the Word Trends chart illustrated the frequency of each throughout.  At points where the lines intersected, I noticed the characters were speaking to each other.  The graph also helped indicate when a character was written out of the story.  At the last instance of any character, I was able to inspect why and how they departed.</p>

<p>Text encoding parses the document in real time and is not reliant on any manual encoding.  This affords speed and the opportunity for scholars to make abstract connections that may be influenced by a markup.  Text encoded and parsed would provide scholars the ability to filter their results by specific XML element(s).</p>

<p>One might use text analysis on Wikipedia articles.  Word frequencies could help ensure the article is written in a scholarly method.  An article with too many contractions, colloquial vocabulary, and other common academic writing mistakes could be identified by a bot.</p>
