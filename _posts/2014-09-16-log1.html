<p>Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) encoding schema, developed by a steering committee, based on the "Poughkeepsie Principles".  The committee systematically categorized and defined features within humanities texts resulting in a schema of 400 tags, which could be extended for future applications.  The first TEI <i>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</i> was published in 1994 and distributed electronically and hardcopy.  TEI influenced markup theory and later schemas such as Encoded Archival Description (EAD), for digital archives and special collections, and the widely used Extensible Markup Language (XML). <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/">A Companion to Digital Humanities</a></p>
