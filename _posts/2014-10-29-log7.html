<p>The Google Ngram Viewer allows users to search large language specific corpora for ngrams (words or phrases) and then graphs the result of each search token as a relative frequency per year within a given time period.</p>

<p>The Viewer can display ngram trends that may be useful for researchers to make abstract connections for further study.  The Viewer is unable to find the ngrams, such as <i>"C++"</i>, containing special search operator characters because there is no way to escape the literal characters.  Searches that included words with more than one meaning inflate or skew the results.  For example, the word <i>Twitter</i> was charted throughout the timeline and spiked just after year 2000.</p>

<p>I performed a case insensitive query for the ngrams, <i>cold war</i> and <i>communism</i> plus <i>terrorism</i> and <i>globalization</i> <sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup>, to see if these terms were collocated and whether there was a cultural shift from writing about the former pair to the latter.  I also chose these ngrams because the Cold War and terrorism represent two major threats to World peace in recent history and communism and globalization are possibly related respectively.  I confined the search results to the years 1945 to 2008 since the Cold War was post World War II.</p>

<p>The ngram graph demonstrates a cultural shift from writing about the Cold War and communism to terrorism and globalization.  The year in which <i>terrorism</i> occurs more frequently than <i>cold war</i> coincides with the September 11<sup style="font-size: inherit !important">th</sup> attacks in 2001.  Beyond that intersection, <i>terrorism</i> spikes significantly and <i>cold war</i> declines in usage slowly.</p>

<p>The next step would be to research why <i>terrorism</i> and <i>globalization</i> are collocated, or even if there is a direct correlation as likely with <i>cold war</i> and <i>communism</i>.</p>

		<h4>Notes:</h4>
		<ol id="notes">
			<li id="note1">I attempted the query (<i>cold war</i> + <i>communism</i>), (<i>terrorism</i> + <i>globalization</i>) to generate lines for each combined ngrams pair.  The results muted some of the interesting spikes of the individual ngrams over the time period so I reverted back to searching the individual ngrams.  Plus, binding the terms together might unintentionally emphasize a correlation.</li>
