<p>Our hypothesis is that new students (and some seasoned ones) are not aware of the quiet study spaces available around campus - except for obvious locations such as the library.</p>

<p>Our group created a Google Map to identify quiet study spaces at the University of Victoria (UVic).  The prototype pinpoints at least 20 different quiet spaces on campus.  Each of these is denoted by a 'pin' on the map, with a short description of its specific location in the building and features.</p>

<p>A map is an appropriate solution for this problem as it provides visual cues for the locations of the quiet study spaces rather than reading verbose directions.  Google Maps is also available across many platforms, especially smartphones.  With the geolocation ability of their phones, students could see at a glance which is the closest quite study space to their location.</p>

<p>Each member of our group contributed five study spaces to the map.  Our contributions were based on personal knowledge, which yielded unique locations.  We were also able to generate a more representative map in about a quarter the time it might have taken an individual.  If our map was open to crowdsourcing, other UVic students could build on our work to generate a thorough map of the UVic quiet study spaces in a relatively short time.  Future enhancements to the map could include users contributing photos, "quietness" rankings, and directions.</p>
