<p><a href="http://salt.unc.edu/T-RACES/">T-RACES</a> is a testbed for the Redlining Archives of California's Exclusionary Spaces.  The overall goal of the site - besides serving as a testbed - is to visually present the boundaries of Confidential Residential Security Maps, prepared by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), on modern day maps of California cities (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>) with supporting documents, where available.</p>

<p>The most prominent classification is geospatial by city.  The project has converted existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a> map boundaries, of some California cities, to Google Maps' coordinates for overlays.  The advantage is that visitors can use Google Maps to interact with the visual representation of the data and zoom in or out or pan.  Researches can then make inferences from this historic data presented on a modern map.  The disadvantage is the same utility may bias any correlation between modern and historic race issues.</p>

<p>The scanned documents are presented in a hierarchical library and, in some cases, are searchable either in their entirety or on specific fields.  HOLC developed the maps in the 30's using a priory system.  Free text searches extend the system for researchers to derive values post hoc and make abstract connections.  The disadvantage is that searchable text is not available for all of the cities.</p>
