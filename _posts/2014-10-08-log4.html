<p>My contribution to Wikipedia was a short sentence at the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Bergmann" target="_blank">Art Bergmann</a> article.  The new content details his latest album release.  See <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a>, where the addition is circled.</p>

<p>My contribution did stick because the source was reputable and verifiable so the contribution would be difficult to contest.  In addition, I am one of two subject matter experts on Bergmann's career.<sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup>   As such, I am usually the first authority to review edits for accuracy.<sup><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>My impression of Wikipedia did not change after this exercise because I have made a few contributions in the past.  However, after reading the New York Times article, <i>Define Gender Gap? Look Up Wikipedia's Contributor List</i>, I began to explore female bands/musicians of Bergmann's era.  I discovered that few had articles; whereas, most, if not all, of the predominantly male bands/musicians were represented.  For example, the Victoria all-female trio, The Dishrags, do not have an article even though they were invited by the London, UK band, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clash" target="_blank">The Clash</a>, to open for them in Vancouver.</p>

<p>The overall Wikipedia process seems more the consensus of a few passionate editors than democratic. One feature is the <i>Talk</i> page associated with each article. Users may use this as an open forum to discuss contributions. Most often these discussions lead to consensus on a contentious edit.</p>
