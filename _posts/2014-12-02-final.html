<p>For my final project I got my hands dirty and migrated my static log website<sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup> to Jekyll rendered GitHub Pages hosting<sup><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup>. <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, the overarching system, is a free online git repository hosting service.  <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> is an open source distributed revision control application for all major operating systems.  <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> is free web hosting for user accounts and per repository.  Effectively GitHub Pages serves static web pages or special HTML or Markdown documents reconstituted with a template by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to form a static blog site.</p>

<p>Since GitHub Pages support static websites without rendering them through Jekyll, I thought experimenting with Jekyll would prove more of a challenge.  I set up a local testing and development environment in a virtualized Linux operating system by installing Jekyll and its dependencies (Ruby programming language and Gems) and verifying git was installed and configured.  All of the tools I used were primarily open source.</p>

<p>Once I set up the development environment and created a special <i>username.github.io</i> repository, for an account level website, I cloned a copy of it locally.  I initialized the local repository with the Jekyll files and started the built-in Jekyll server for building and testing the site.  For each existing log page, I removed everything unnecessary to Jekyll; added any Jekyll specific content required; committed it locally; and pushed the changes to the online repository.  I then experimented with git branches when applying a custom template and other enhancements.  I tracked some of the issues that arose during testing using the GitHub bug tracker associated with the repository too.</p>

<p>Choosing a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> (CC) license for my project proved to be an interesting and lengthy exercise.  I used the "Choose a License" tool and ended up with an <i>Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license</i>, which I added to my slides and posts.  When I applied the <a href="https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean" target="_blank">Jekyll Clean</a><sup><a href="#note3">[3]</a></sup> theme, by Scott Emmons, I needed to credit his work and denote that I made changes.  I discovered his license was more flexible as it didn’t restrict users to a share alike model.  I promoted my template license to match his and retained the slightly more restrictive one for my other work.  I trust that mixing-and-matching licenses is acceptable given I referenced what content was covered by each.</p>

<p>Most of my classmates’ questions or comments were regarding the complexity of git and GitHub Pages (implying Jekyll).  Considering I am a fourth year Computer Science major, with years of personal computer experience, and struggled somewhat with the complexities of Jekyll, I feel that it may be beyond the skills of the average Digital Humanist.  The "blogging like a hacker"<sup><a href="#note4">[4]</a></sup> design philosophy of Jekyll is also well suited for smaller blog-style sites associated with GitHub user accounts or repositories.  Larger projects, with many contributors, might be better served by a content management system (CMS) such as Joomla!, WordPress, Drupal, etc...  However, I strongly encourage Digital Humanists to invest time into learning git and one of the many online repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc...)  The key features of git and shared repositories are in keeping with the Wiki-scholarship principles of the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0<sup><a href="#note5">[5]</a></sup>.  git includes <b>iterative</b> version control; <b>cumulative</b> non-linear workflow; and <b>collaborative</b> development.  In addition, other users may <i>clone</i> repositories and repurpose or remix the original into a new derivative.</p>

<p>In conclusion, one question I kept posing to myself was: would I use GitHub Pages again?  I never settled on a definitive answer as the choice would depend on the skillset of any other collaborators; and size, nature, and complexity of the project.  I oscillated between thinking Jekyll is terrific to reflecting on how it might confound other project members.  I also struggled with reimagining GitHub as a place to develop projects other than open source software.  My instinct, at this time, is probably not.</p>
